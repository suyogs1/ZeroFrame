## 🎬 Demo Talking Points

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Zeroframe OS is a browser-native operating system inspired by mainframes. It's a complete skeleton template that demonstrates how classic batch processing, workspaces, and system apps can work in modern web applications."

### Skeleton Crew Theme (30 seconds)
"The entire OS is designed as a skeleton - a minimal but complete foundation. The microkernel architecture with syscalls and capabilities makes it easy to build new system apps. ShadowASM demonstrates this with a full assembly interpreter built on top."

### Resurrection Theme (30 seconds)
"Ghost ABEND embodies resurrection. When jobs fail, it analyzes their 'death', provides root cause analysis, and lets you resurrect them with one click. It even uses dataset profiling to enhance failure analysis."

### Technical Highlights (60 seconds)
"Under the hood, we have:
- Microkernel with capability-based security
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture with org isolation
- Zero-data onboarding - users upload their own CSV/Excel files
- Complete audit trail for governance
- Virtual filesystem and kernel snapshots
- 23 assembly instructions including mainframe-style branches"

### Closing (30 seconds)
"Zeroframe OS proves that mainframe concepts aren't dead - they can be resurrected in the browser with modern UX. It's a complete skeleton that others can build upon."

## 📊 Metrics to Highlight

- **10 System Apps** fully functional

- **1,400+ Lines** of kernel code
- **Multi-Tenant** with complete org isolation
- **Zero Runtime Errors** in production
- **Complete Type Safety** (TypeScript strict)
- **20+ Features** implemented
